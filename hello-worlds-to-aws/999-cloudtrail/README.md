# CloudTrail
All the AWS services accessed through AWS Cosole, SDK and CLI are logged using CloudTrail.

AWS CloudTrail logs management events (It means CRUD on all the AWS services, for e.g., ec2 instances create/delete/modify/list) across AWS services by default for all regions. These management events are delivered for free in S3 bucket by default.  If you create additonal trail and log the same management events in another bucket, it'll cost you money.

You can view 90-day history of your accountâ€™s management events for free using AWS console or the AWS CLI Lookup API.

Use your 'myaws-admin' user name to look for all the AWS management events you have been creating so far.
```
 aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=myaws-admin --max-items 50 --query 'Events[*].{EventId:EventId,EventName:EventName,EventSource:EventSource,EventTime:EventTime}'
```
