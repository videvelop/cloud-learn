# hello-worlds
This repository contains some hello-world programs and scripts.

These programs/scripts will be used to learn cloud services and various cloud architecture paradigms:
  
    1. Lift-and-shift from on-prem data center to cloud's compute/storage / network services
    2. Migrate with cloud provided services (for e.g., AWS Database Migration Service)
    3. Deploy with cloud managed services (for e.g, AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service)
    4. Deploy in cloud and go serverless (for e.g., AWS' Lambda, DynamoDB)

To deploy these hello worlds in AWS refer the repository https://github.com/videvelop/hello-worlds-to-aws .
Deploy in Google Cloud Platform and Azure will be covered later.
